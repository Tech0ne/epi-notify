Get notified on intranet notifications.

This tool let you link to the Epitech Intranet and retreive your callendar to discord, or callendars

I don't have the heart to go back dive on how it work to make a clean doc right now, but feel free to contact me if you want to use this tool / want to continue developpement.

It worked well as a PoC.

Main keypoints were:
- Discord integration: receive pings when activities start
- Callendar support (through nylas): retreive your intra callendar to google agenda
- ntfy integration: receive pop up notifications on events
- all contained: everything runs within a singular docker compose
- browser integration: one of the most anying part is that you must retreive your intra token, but this can be automatic using one of the web browser's extensions
